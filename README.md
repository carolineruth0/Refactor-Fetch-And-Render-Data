Title: Refactor Fetch and Render Data

Description: This project fetches and renders data from balldontlie. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course with edits by me.

How to run: Download all files. Node.js is required. Use powershell and navigate to the folder with the downloads. Start a server in that folder and put its address in your browser.

Future improvements: I would like to edit what data is rendered and update the style.
